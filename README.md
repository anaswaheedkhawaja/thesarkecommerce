Project Description
The e-commerce website will be built using React, a popular front-end library for creating interactive user interfaces. React will allow us to create reusable components, manage the state of the application, and optimize the performance of the website. The website will also use Bootstrap, a framework for developing responsive and mobile- friendly web pages.
The website will have the following features and functionalities:
• Home Page: The home page will display the logo, the navigation bar, the search bar, and the featured products. The navigation bar will include links to other pages, such as categories, cart, and account. The featured products will show the best-selling or recommended products on the website.
• Category Page: The category page will display the products that belong to a specific category, such as clothing, electronics, or books. The products will be displayed in a grid layout, with the product image, name, price. The users will also be able to click on a product to view its details.
• Product Page: The product page will display the details of a selected product, such as the product image, name, price, description, and specifications.
• Cart Page: The cart page will display the products that the users have added to the cart.
